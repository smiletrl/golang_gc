## Golang garbage collection examples

Garbage Collection(i.e, gc) could play a vital effect on golang application performance. This repository demonstrates examples on how garbage collection works.

These examples could serve as a general reference for understanding golang gc phenomena. Different scenarios need explicit analysis to debug the performance related with golang gc though.

Result of this repository is based on go version: go version go1.15.8 darwin/amd64

File redis.pdf was downloaded from [redislabs](https://redislabs.com/). Here it works for a file sample.

I'm happy to get feedback if you feel these examples are helpful or not-that helpful :) You are also welcome to contribute more examples to help people to understand Golang garbage collection better.
